1) single-variant. break each chromosome into equally-sized segments.
2) aggregate tests. select subsets of aggregate blocks.
3) sliding window. break chromosome into chunks, with some overlap.

combine at end: for sliding window, need to remove overlaps.

can we combine all these into a single system with slight variation?
blocks for sliding window could also be used for single-variant, with removal of overlap.
use same blocks for aggregate test - a unit is assigned to the block if its first variant lies in that block.

terminology: block, chunk, or segment?

define segment by position, not individual variants - so it can be reused for later freezes.
get start and end position of chromosomes in hg19.
mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A -e "select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo order by chrom"

use dplyr with database?
